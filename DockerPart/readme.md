### In order to use these containers, what you need to do is :
Mount the folders that are placed in the folder named "folder_needed" in the root directory, these folders will be mounted to the different containers used in this project, for example the mongodb folder contains all data needed to run the container (collections and other staff), the problems folder contains the different test cases for different folders, the submissions folder contains the output file of the different submissions and represents the place where communication is being done between compilation container and main_app container.
